# Washing the car 

Keep your car looking great by washing it regularly.

1.  Move the car onto the driveway. Avoid washing the car in direct sunlight as this might damage the paint.
2.  Attach the water hose to a spout and pull the free end over to the car.
3.  Fill a bucket with soapy water.
4.  Use a sponge to apply the soapy water to the car and gently remove the dirt.
5.  Rinse the car by spraying clean water from the hose.
6.  Dry the car using a dampened chamois.
