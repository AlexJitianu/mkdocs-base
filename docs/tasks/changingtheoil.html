# Changing the oil in your car {#changing.oil .task}

Once every 6000 kilometers or three months, change the oil in your car.

Changing the oil regularly will help keep the engine in good condition.

1.  To change the oil:
2.  Remove the old oil filter.
3.  Drain the old oil.
4.  Recycle the oil and oil filter by taking them to the nearest service station or auto shop.
5.  Install the drain plug.
6.  Install a new oil filter and gasket. Most oil filters need to be tightened by hand. Overtightening them might damage the gasket.
7.  Add new oil to the engine.
8.  Check the air filter and replace or clean it.
9.  Top up the windshield washer fluid.

Recommanded oil types:

|Type|Temperature|
|----|-----------|
|5W-20|low|
|10W-30|high|
