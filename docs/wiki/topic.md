# LW-DITA {#topic_elz_sfk_zw}

Lightweight DITA can be used in the **ghd-wiki** project, thus you can take advantage of controlled authoring experience by providing placeholders, hints, inline actions and inline form controls.

Lightweight DITA is a great alternative to Markdown, having the same or less complexity degree while being very clearly specified. The user interface takes advantage of controlling the authoring experience through placeholders, hints, inline actions and form controls to edit attribute values in place, all these combined to provide a simple user interface suitable for any contributors

It is very easy to create content in LW-DITA, especially if you can benefit of some help from the authoring tool. The [oXygen XML Web Author](https://oxygenxml.com/xml_web_author.html) is an example of such a tool, that provides special support for working with LW-DITA, support that can be extended further to match your actual needs.
